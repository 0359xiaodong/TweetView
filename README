This project is an example Android Twitter feed reader app
from the Codehenge Android development tutorial:

http://www.codehenge.net/blog/

It is designed as a learning aid, and written for illustrative purposes. 

This project was developed in Eclipse, and includes all associated files.

I've also packaged in the open source simple-json library used in the example.

Feel free to fork, modify, or do anything you want with this code.
