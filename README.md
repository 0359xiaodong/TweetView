##TweetView

This project is an example Android Twitter feed reader app
from the Codehenge Android development tutorial:

http://www.codehenge.net/blog/

It is designed as a learning aid, and written for illustrative purposes. This project was developed in Eclipse, and includes all associated files. I've also packaged in the open source simple-json library used in the example.

This code is free as in both speech and beer. Feel free to fork, modify, or do anything you want with this code.
